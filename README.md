Combine Spelljammer and Planetbreaker in a modernistic 5e, or maybe not modern.. that's going to be up to you

Certain aspects of races and classes will have suggested updates in a manner similiar to d20 Modern or Urban Arcana.

So, if you are ready for a fun, not to serious but should be a great story.. This is going to be the campaign for you.
